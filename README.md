## Overview

The Transformer model is a state-of-the-art neural network architecture designed for sequence-to-sequence tasks, such as machine translation. It utilizes the self-attention mechanism to capture long-range dependencies and improve parallelization, making it highly efficient and effective for processing sequential data.

**Important Note:** The goal of this project is to provide a deep understanding of the Transformers architecture and its inner workings. So, it's mainly for educational purposes. You can fully understand the structure and working mechanism of this model here, and use the components I have implemented in your projects.

## Features

- Implementation of the Transformer model from scratch in TensorFlow 2.
- Training the model on a dataset of English-French sentence pairs.
- Custom positional encodings, attention mechanisms and etc.
- Learning rate schedule with warmup for training.
- Monitoring and early stopping using custom callbacks.
- Inferance.

## Credits
The implementation of the Transformer model is based on the paper "Attention is All You Need" by Vaswani et al. The code in this repository is developed by Ali Haidar Ahmad and is only for educational purposes.

## Usage

1. Prepare the Data:
* Place your English-French sentence pairs in a text file, with each pair separated by a tab character.
* Normalize, Vectorize and make tf.data format using the data_processing.py script.

2. Train the Model:
* Set the hyperparameters in the Config class in the config.py script.
* Create the Transformer model and custom learning rate schedule using the Transformer and LrSchedule classes in the model.py script.
* Compile the model with the appropriate loss function and optimizer.
* Train the model using the fit method and monitor the training progress.

3. Translate Sentences:
* Load the trained model using the load_model function in the load_model.py script.
* Use the trained model to generate translations for English sentences using the translate function in the model.py script.
